2,Alexis A Vagni,No instructions and very weak design,"The “instructions” do not explain how to assemble and YouTube videos I tried to find were not helpful. We had to twist and turn and use trial and error to figure out what pieces went where—it was terrible (and I’m usually pretty good at figuring these things out). Then they give the tiniest little clips to use to rest each shelf on, only if you put them on one side of a vertical piece, you can’t put one on the other side (to be able to put a shelf in the next column). Not only can you not then put shelves next to one another, but the piece is so microscopic that it cannot bear the weight of the shoe! The shelf can barely rest on the tiny piece without falling off. I cannot understand the design of these pieces or how customers are expected to actually use them. As in the picture, you can see that I had to use an elaborate design of string strung back and forth through the holes of the vertical pieces to be able to rest the shelves upon, hoping that they would be able to hold the shelves up and bear the weight of the shoes (just regular shoes, mind you). It seems to work, but no one should have to be a “string engineer” here—the product is weak.##",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 23, 2022",
3,Marie Crawford,Don't move it!!!,"The pictures and descriptions on Amazon are amazing. The assembly instructions are beyond bad. Some of the online customer videos helped a bit more. DO NOT attempt to move it after it has been assembled or you will find yourself practically starting over. Once we got it completely assembled and in its final resting place, it seems pretty sturdy. The biggest problem now is that the doors will not stay shut on their own and there are no latches included. My daughter still loves it, and I am just trying to figure out some type of latch system.##",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 6, 2022",

5,William U Oribhabor,different but better,"On my wife's account, in 2019 I bought a similar product made by Langria. It is an excellent product. So, when I saw these shelves for myself, I bought them. I must say that these were much easier to put together and required much less effort. I put in the review of their product that zip ties should be included. Well, this set came with zip ties and it comes with a mallet too! Well, I definitely needed the mallet. But, I found the end product to be not much different. However. I like it that white is nice and cleaner than the black one I bought last year. Also, I still agree with my last review that a pair of needle nose plyers are mandatory. It only took me about an hour to build this module. Thank you for putting this on the market. I love the idea how the shelves are sitting on little tabs rather than the buttons that Langria put at every shelf. Like I said. This is easier to put together. And, although the bottons (round connectors) may be harder to connect to the frame of this set, (ergo - mallet), the pay off is the winged shelf tabs.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 10, 2020",

27,Napa,There are pros and cons; overall satisfied,"Pros:Overall good price, easy to assemble, and good quality to be able to support all my shoes. Some reviews mentioned easy to collapse; those were probably installed incorrectly or didn't push the panels deep enough into the connectors. If you don't have strong hands to push the panels, just use the little hammer that comes with the package. Easy for me without using the hammer.There's also a sheet of paper with content of package on one page and instructions on the back but it was easy enough to put together the set without the instructions.Cons:The total number of ABS connectors and small snap clippers for the middle shelves are exactly what's needed to put all cubes together as one big piece, without any backup or extra. There would be no rescue if a few of these were missing, defective or simply stripped.Some customers also questioned about the possibility of building 2 separate sets - 3 cubes in one room and another 3 cubes in another room - thinking there are enough panels, but no you can't because there aren't enough connectors!

And I almost wish I would have gotten a bigger size so that I could have a bigger stack for my other shoes because I ended up finding out I had so many lol. The plastic is not a cheap vinyl which is nice, but I would be afraid that heavy shoes would cause the shelves to buckle eventually after having a lot of weight on them.And the doors don't have any kind of mechanism that can keep them shut. So I kind of had to use the shelving itself to do that.##",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 26, 2021",

35,D. E. Reagan,Good For Living On The Edge,"It was past time to replace my dollar store chef knife with a decent set with a bread knife and no steak knives. I first looked at Wüsthof as I always liked that brand, but never owned any. I used a borrowed paring knife for a while and was impressed with the quality. My line cooking time is over and though I would have liked to have a set of forged Wüsthofs, the price was too much for occasional use. My favorite chef knife was a 10"" wide Victorinox/Forschner until it got stolen. I replaced it with an 8"" version, but it was not wide and felt very different. Still my first choice for stamped high-carbon stainless steel blades. Again, the price for a set was a bit high for use once in a while.I spotted the Amazon Basics 9-Piece Premium Kitchen Knife Block Set. Wait. A forged high carbon stainless steel knife set for that price? I read through all the reviews even the one with the picture of the broken knife, the set seems to be a good buy. Certainly better than a dollar-store knife and a few dollars more than an empty knife block.While I haven't given them a good workout on food yet, I can tell they are very good given the price. I would have liked the chef's knife to be a bit wider, but I can live with it as is. I tried the index finger and thumb holding test on the chef knife and it was comfortable, but not so much on the Santoku knife. I am new to the Santoku Knife. I guess I would hold and use it more like a cleaver. The knives all feel pretty sharp out of the box, though like nearly all new knives, they need some fine-tuning to be really sharp.Sure they are not a top-name branded knife set and if I was still a working line cook I would choose a different set, but as a casual home cook, I like these very much.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2023",

44,Moke,NOT carbon steel - just stainless,"Many years ago, when I first left home, one of my first purchases was a set of kitchen knives from Hoffritz which I have treasured over the years, despite it not holding an edge in recently, because it was not carbon steel. Even though I am now 74 I decided to purchase another really good set. But the price tag was staggering: over $800 in many cases. Finally, after searching and searching this Amazon set popped up and it was only $50 but said it was carbon steel. I kind of knew that was too good to be true, and, alas, when I got them they said stainless.  They are decent and probably good enough at this point in my life, but I really do not think they should advertise falsely that they are carbon steel.##",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2023",

47,R C.,This Set Has Given Great Service,"I'm a bit slow to review these knives, and I'll tell you why in a moment. I purchased this set in December of 2015, and the knives have given me fine daily service for over 5 years now. They sharpen and clean up well, and do everything I have asked them to. I use them for personal cooking. They clean up well, and still look brand new. If I needed another knife set, I'd buy these again in a heartbeat. I think the price is fair, good value for money, and the set looks great on my kitchen counter.So why am I writing a review of this knife set in January, 2021? Because today, I simply picked up one of the steak knifes out of my kitchen sink drying rack, and the blade simply broke in half in my hand. Right in the middle of the shaft in a straight line. I know my kitchen knives have never been used for prying or anything of that nature, so this was truly surprising. It simply made me think to review the set since I had gotten so much good use out of it. This is by no means a complaint about the knives. I think they have done a great job for me, and just about everything made by man breaks eventually if you use it enough.The good news is that I looked online here at Amazon, and I can buy a set of 8 exact replacements for $21. I only need one, but so what? I'll just keep the others as spares. I think it is great that I don't have to replace the whole knife set and block. This has been one of my better kitchen purchases. Definitely a recommended buy.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 28, 2021",

I have owned $500+ knife sets.  Outside of the block esp printed with Amazon Basics and Made in China printed on each blade, they look the part.  Full tang and decent steel.

55,draco7891,Forged Knives at a Stamped-Knife Price,"Purchased as a gift for a friend suffering with an old, rusted, chipped set of cheap big-box knives.As far as I can tell, these are one-piece forged/milled knives with a full tang... no idea how Amazon gets them so cheap. I have a set of J.A. Henckels Four-Star that were 5x the price, and these knives are almost as nice in fitment and quality. Some of the grinds at the bolster aren't quite symmetrical, but nothing that functionally affects the knife. Not show-dogs, just old reliable mutts that get you where you need to be.Knives have a good weight and balance, not too heavy but sit well in the hand and have a nice action. The edge out of the box is only average, and the chef's knife had a decent roll to the edge out of the box. However, they sharpen easily and can take a fine edge with a little work with the steel (no word on edge longevity yet, they don't cook that often).The shears come apart for cleaning (which is nice), although I found it a little too unstable when opening them wide, the rivet is at 90* so when taking a big bite they have a tendency to come apart rather than scissor. Changing to a design that doesn't separate until they're fully open would make them much better.The woodblock is pine, and had a distinct pine scent out of the box (I suppose this is an area where they saved money, I would pay a premium to get a bamboo block instead). The exterior was well-finished, but the interiors of the knife slots did have some rough spots and/or splinters from the milling. Nothing that stops it from working as intended, a little back and forth solved the majority of problems.Friend hand washed them after receiving them, but left them damp. Water spots, but no rust on any of the blades, the steel had light surface rust that came off with a scrubby sponge and soap. Overall I remain optimistic they will stand up to the abuse of a forgetful cook.Having bought expensive German steel, and now these, I daresay I would probably be unable to tell the difference between the two in the kitchen.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 27, 2015",
56,MichaelJK,Very nice knife set,Knives are VERY sharp! They work well. They look durable. Nice to have a sharpener with the set. The wood block is the only thing that brought the knife set down.

58,Eric H.,Amazing for the price,"At a higher price they would have been 4 or 3 stars, but for $50 this is an insane deal. The steel is pretty good quality. It almost seems like it's hardened VG-10 but I think they would advertise that if it were so I'm guessing it's a cheaper stainless steel that just comes harder without being treated though I'm just speculating based on price. Anyways they're flat ground, take an edge easily, and hold it reasonably well. Nicer knives would certainly hold an edge longer but I'm pretty happy with them. The flat ground shape of the blade is actually ever so slightly convex as well, it's not too apparent in use but you can certainly see it in the reflection. The serration on the bread knife is the inverse of what I would prefer, rounded metal with points cut into it vs points extending from the blade with the rounded parts cut out. When the rounded parts are cut out it's easy to sharpen. When the points are cut out it's almost impossible to sharpen.The handles are the downfall of the knives. They're not smoothly finished and while they look alright they feel like a cheaply cut (although very solid) piece of plastic which is exactly what they are. A little bit better finishing on the handles would really improve the knives.The holding block serves it's purpose well. The sharpener is ok but below average, though the rough steel rod sharpeners just aren't great to begin with. Diamond coated rods are much better, though ceramic rod sharpeners are the best.Overall I love the knives and I'm glad I bought them. For the price they're the best deal I've ever found, no question. I love that there is no logo on them, but I just don't like to see branding in general even if it's a premium brand. If you're buying this for the bread knife or the sharpener, don't, they're not good. If you want the look and feel of a $300+ knife set, don't buy this, you'll be disappointed. If you want a good quality knife set but aren't willing to spend $300+ then absolutely buy these, they're great.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 3, 2016",

61,Mark V,Great set of knives balanced between cost and quality,"I was in the market for a new set of knives because my old set, a long ago gift from my well intentioned parents, was serrated. I have also had some ""fancier"" knives over time as well including a Wushtof chef's knife and a Shun santoku knife. So when I started looking to replace my knife set, I started looking at various different brands.My main goal was to find a balance between the quality of the knives and the cost, as in many cases, knives can get expensive pretty quickly. I also knew that I didn't really need the steak knives that often come with these sets because we hardly entertain, which means not a significant need for steak knives.When I saw these, I thought ""This can't be for real for this price...""The knives work well, offering all the sizes and types I need for basic cooking. They are balanced fairly well, and while I could see some people not liking the plastic handles rather than wood, it doesn't really bother me. They are comfortable both in my grip and also in my wife's, who has smaller hand than I do. We find them easy to work with, from meats to fruits and veggies. They feel pretty solid, and appear to be full tang knives (all one piece of metal down through the handle, not welded together). I am pretty confident they will hold up for years with regular care, all at a price that is at or below many other introductory sets of knives.The block is a basic block of solid wood, as you would expect with most knife sets. The holes for the knives aren't cut exactly to the blade sizes, but honestly it doesn't really matter that it's not exact, as all the knives are able to fit in the slots. The rubber feet keep it in place on the counter, and the block is sealed/laminated to stand up to standard kitchen wear and exposure.I would recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a good balance between quality and cost, who needs a good set of knives to get them going in the kitchen and be functional, without breaking the bank.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 3, 2015",

64,eightbitsoul,I see you've played knifey-spoony before.,"I bought this 18-piece AmazonBasic knife block set for my dad for Christmas and I'm very pleasingly pleased.In comparison to the 25 year old dull-as-dog-turd knives he previously had, these things are wicked sharp. I could literally take his old chef's knife and run it across my face and it would merely tickle. That's how dull they were. I mean, they cut the same if you were holding the blade and using them backwards. So, yeah, anything would be better than those, I guess.But these new knives really impressed me for the price. You get an 18 piece set for ~ $60. That means they're not professional knives. But who cares? You're not a professional knifer, are you? (I make that assumption on account of the fact you're looking at cheap knives). But that doesn't matter, because for the average person who just needs a pretty good set of knives to cut things (preferably food), these really can't be beat. I mean, they're mighty sharp. That's good. They have full tangs. That's also good. They're stainless steel. That's... debatable. But anyway...I also like the fact that the AmazonBasics logo isn't all over everything. It's just on the block. So now you can buy some Wusthoff or Henckels stickers to apply to the handles and make your friends think you're a big dog in the knife world. But be sure to constantly work the word ""Solingen"" into conversation. That will totally throw them off your scent.Here's a big tip to keeping these nice knives nice for as long as possible: DO NOT ever put these in your dishwasher, you lazy mother. And don't ever throw them in the sink for a couple days. Use them, HAND WASH them and immediately dry them, then put them back in the block. I know this takes a bit of effort in this hectic, mixed-up, crazy world, but it's worth it.Don't fear buying these knives. And don't fear the reaper, either.

This AmazonBasics Premium set really impressed me. The knives I use and have at home are mixed matched because I like good hefty knives. My wife always rags on me that the knives look crappy, so I got on here and started reading reviews. I was not gonna spend alot of money on a set knowing that I have good knives already. Then I saw this set, and looked at the video.I got them in TWO days, and when I opened the package I was expecting the block to be split, chipped, or have saw marks. As you can see the one I got was flawless. I then took out the chefs knife and smiled. Easily comparable to a 8"" Zwilling JA Henckels Pro Traditional Chefs Knife. It has the same quality, heft, and balance. TRUST ME I KNOW!!!! Beautiful knife. The thickness of the blade is equal to my Victorinox Fibrox Chefs Knife and I paid $45. for that knife alone!!!

They have the Sharpness, Look, Weight & Feel of the Imported ""non-German"" Henckel Knives made in china.  Those knives are great, but your average import set is still around $200....For $50 for these knives - they're super sharp, been using them daily for over a month and every time I see them and use them I smirk... because of the GREAT Deal I got on them, and saved so much money vs buying a big name brand set of the same quality!!!I'm a person who likes quality, and usually name brand products have that top of the line quality I look for, but these Amazon Knives have that high quality but with a price that makes you wonder if they'll last, or be sharp or be as good as a $200+ knife set.The only knife that was a little weird was the 8"" Bread knife, usually the bread knives inverted cutting, but this is external rounded cutting.  The knife does actually slice through bread easier with its blade configuration... but its super sharp and cuts through a baguette like a hot knife through butter as they say!!!I could sit here and write a life story on these knives on how amazing they are, but I have to get back to work!  Buy them - YOU WILL NOT BE DISSSAPOINTED.

76,Henry S.,First time getting excited about knives,"I never though much of knives.  My first set of knives were a cheap Farberware set from Walmart, similar to the ones my parents had when I was growing up.  I never sharpened them and I always threw them in the dishwasher, so they had rust spots.I was afraid to pay extra for the AmazonBasics Premium line because the handles look similar to my cheap ones in the pictures.  However, it was a huge difference--it is not cheap plastic and really lives up to the ""premium"" in the title.  The steak knives are heavy, like those at steakhouses.  I've become protective of these and always hand wash and hand dry immediately after using.  By the way, I don't think it is enough to avoid the dishwasher to prevent rust spots.  You probably also have to avoid letting them soak in the sink (I have no proof, but my wife did get in trouble by leaving some knives in the sink).I was also hesitant to buy these because some of the reviewers said that they dulled after a few months.  However, when I watched a video to learn how to sharpen the knives and they suggested doing a quick sharpening either before or after each use.  I only do it after several uses, but they seem just as sharp after several months of almost daily use.Verdict: If you are willing to sharpen, hand wash, and hand dry then these are great and will probably last a very long time.  Otherwise, stick to your cheap Walmart set so you can simply replace them when they are dull and rusted.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2016",
77,Blossomthyme,You get what you pay for,I purchased two sets of these for my daughter-in-law and my mother.  Fortunately for them they don't use them very often.  I gifted myself with one of the knives from my daughter-in-law's set.  She doesn't cook and we traded for one of my cleavers.  I haven't had any problem with the one knife I kept for myself after more than a year.  I don't see any problem with my Mom's knives either when I visit her.  I'll probably have to sharpen them for her.  I have sharpened the one I kept and it operates well.  I slipped it in there where a Wusthof knife would have gone to add to my set of Wusthof knives.  I love them and won't trade them for anything.  This is a great buy if you're starting out or you don't know anything about knives.  I don't think they are forged steel.  I was looking for that somewhere and couldn't find it anyway.  So I'm guessing these knives will rust and possibly break in time.

They're extremely sharp (I've sliced my skin several times and didn't realize it until I saw my blood drops on the plates I was handling), s be careful. I've washed these both in the dishwasher as well as in the sink - I always rinse them well and dry them immediately, and sometimes I use a piece of paper towel dampened with oil (any cooking oil) to just rub the blades and the handle after drying them out. Zero rust so far. The wooden block that some reviewers stated was chipped - mine came in perfect condition, not a scratch on it.  So I'm happy. And let's say, even if these go dull from using them - knife sharpener blocks or sponges were invented, and I know how to use them (LOL).

81,Brian - SummaeStudios,"Beautiful high quality knives, my block(s) had issues","The knives themselves are so far quite incredible, quite well made, solid tang through and through, classic three rivet design, seemingly high quality, durable handle material, strong, solid bolster, good quality steel, and very sharp. I also like the selection, including a long bread knife, chef's knife, and santoku, among others. If you search on Amazon for knife set, and compare these to name brands, Wusthoff, J.A. Henckels, Calphalon, Cangshan, and even Ginsu and Chicago Cutlery, you will find that any of their sets that are forged and include a bolster generally begin at almost twice the price for the same selection of knives, while the Wusthoff, Henckels and Cangshan start at over $200 for a smaller number of knives.One caveat I've found is the block is not good. When I received my first set, it seemed absolutely fine, until I turned the block over to discover it was moldy. Many of the pieces of wood that composed the block were moldy through and through, and the knives would certainly touch the mold when inserted into the block. I return this first set, and the second set had exactly the same issue - the knives were wonderful, but the block was again moldy, so I called Amazon, explained I loved the knives, but as the second block had the same issue as the first, there was a good chance this would keep happening. The rep offered me a discount, and so I kept the great knives, and will purchase a knife strip, which will save space anyway.##",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2016",

Unless you demand the finest, cutco, wusthof, henckels, etc. Look no further.I'd put these on par with lower-middle range henckels and wusthof knives... but at a much lower cost.I snagged an ""open box"" warehouse deal and got these bad boys for $46. I'd be happy if I paid double. They (not surprisingly) blew my sunbeam knives out of the water. Those of which I left the poor review they deserved.These are very sharp out of the box, be careful with them. I just cut through peppers and partially frozen pork with ease using the chef knife in record (for me anyway) time. An entire 6 qt crock pot filled to the top in a matter of minutes and I'm no chef.I find them of comparable sharpness to my mother's cutco set, I doubt they will hold the edge as long or resist corrosion as well. But at 1/10th the cost I don't expect them to.Bottom line, in the sub $100 segment these are serious knives.***** Update***** 8/30/15These still rock, very sharp and zero signs of rust or any other kind of corrosion.

My parents have a nice set of Chicago Cutlery knives they've had for twenty years or so, and they tend to be the metric by which I compare knives. I looked all over the place, in stores, and on Amazon for my own set. I found a Chicago Cutlery set that I liked, but I've heard some bad things about a supposed drop in quality they've had over the years. Right before I was going to order them, this set popped up in ""recommended"" feed.For starters, it was *exactly* the set I wanted. Other sets had most of the knives I wanted, but would be missing the Santoku or something. Others were too small, still others had knives I didn't need or want. This, however, had everything exactly - right down to the serrated steak knives. And for half the price, I figured why not go for it? So I did. And they've been amazing. Daily use out of the Santoku and Chef's Knife for the last two months, and I still have yet to sharpen either. They have a nice weight, they feel balanced, and they look really nice. I saw some other reviewers maybe had some issues with the knife block, but all of mine fit evenly and look great.If you're looking for a good set of knives on a budget, these are the way to go.

They are amazing for the price and if you care for them, they will last a long time. The wooden block is pine and smells very strongly of pine oil, but that is a bonus if you ask me. The only thing about the block is that it has some left over factory sawdust in the knife slots. No big deal, but you need to clean those slots out before putting the knives in their slots.

Our small apartment in NYC has two kitchen drawers (SERIOUSLY), and I realized that we needed more a compact way to hold a greater variety in knives. I purchased this because it addressed all of these issues.Pros:- great variety. I literally use, and have used, all of the knives included with this set. I love the inclusion of the santoku.- very sharp, and easy to sharpen. these came sharp sharp sharp. nothing crazy, but I love using a seriously sharp knife. the sharpener works well enough.- compact and low profile for countertop. the color is muted enough that it fits into a corner easily, and is not very noticeable. The classic black knives look great, with no branding.- hidden branding - the block has branding on one side, but that side faces the wall. perfect!Cons:- these are all cheaper knives, as evidenced by the price. they may not last forever. they may not impress your chef friends. but for the price, I would buy them again and again and again.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 6, 2016",
93,Docj085,Impressive.,"After buying what we thought was a quality Chicago cutlery set a few months ago, we made the mistake of putting them in a dishwasher and then becoming frustrated when they started to rust. That led to a lot of research into what makes a kitchen knife high quality. Things I learned were 1) pretty much never put kitchen knives in the dishwasher (it will cause most knives to rust eventually), 2) high carbon stainless steel is better than regular stainless steel, 3) forged knives are higher quality than stamped knives, 4) a knife has a better balance when it's forged and when the metal runs all the way through the handle.Understand, this is a very basic explanation. I'm in no way a professional chef. My wife and I just wanted a set that would look good, cut well, and feel like good quality. This set is all of that and then some. My experience with Amazonbasics is that they are very simple, functional products. I have to say this product goes beyond that because immediately when you pick up the knives they have a high quality feel to them. You'll notice a huge difference between knives in a similar price range. I would argue they are of similar quality to knive sets that sell for double the price. My wife was a bit skeptical of these seeing as how quickly the Chicago cutlery set disappointed, but we're both VERY happy with the quality of the knives. The wood block also has a quality feel and weight too it. Great job Amazon.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 18, 2015",

104,Dan R,"Worth the price, but not comfortable.","I found the handles to be a lot more angular than it seems like in the photos, and were much shorter than I expected.  This made the knives extremely uncomfortable to hold and awkward to handle (and having recently flayed open a finger due to slipping while deboning a duck [not with these knives]... finesse with a knife is important to me).  I've got decently large hands though, so you may find that this isn't as big of an issue.Otherwise, the knives were sharp, though less so than I expected (side by side potato slicing comparison to a new cheap Victorinox showed the latter as a clear winner).  I do not know it running them through a sharpener can improve this.  The knives had a good heft to them, but that also made them all the more awkard to hold due to the handles.The block looks nice, and is solid.

I don't understand the placement of the steak knives on the front of the block, but as that is standard, I can't really fault this product for it (the handles block access to the actual knives, and are used much less so why not put them in the back?).All in all, at this price point this would be a great set for a 2nd property, but I wouldn't use it as a primary set.  This set probably has knives that will never see much use (really a chef's knife, paring knife, bread knife, and boning knife are all you'll need), but at the price the extra knives are just bonuses.I returned the set due to the short uncomfortable handles, and will be using a la carte Victorinox knives instead.##",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 26, 2016",

107,Aerofoto,Buy them right now and never look back.,"My review really is just going to echo the many rave reviews of this knife set. The description is not kidding when they say ""Professional grade stainless"". It is high-grade, high-carbon stainless steel. I don't know where the metal is sourced from, but it's NOT the cheap stuff. The knives are very sharp and have been after two months of use. The knives have not rusted or discolored yet even after many handwashes and soaks in the sink. This is what I think of when I hear or read about stainless steel - it won't rust easily. However, EVERY other knife set I have ever owned, some of them in the $300 range, has rusted or discolored after only a few washes. These have not. Quite pleased about that. The knife block is very basic, but does its job. I would say my biggest complaint is with the scissors/shears. They come apart VERY easily. Nearly every time I try to use them, they come apart at some point. They are designed to do this for cleaning, which I appreciate. I just take some extra caution when using them and it's fine.Overall, perfect knife set at twice the price. At this price, it's a steal. Buy it now and never look back.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2016",

109,imerica.e,A fabulous addition to your kitchen!,"While these knives are obviously very reasonably priced, they really are great quality, too! When we were first married, I was gifted a kitchen aid knife set. It seemed nice at first but very quickly deteriorated -- and I NEVER run my knives through the dishwasher. I consider myself to be fairly advanced in the kitchen as compared to my peers, so when I got these knives in the mail, I was shocked at how well they impressed me. We had just moved to a new place and I ordered something quickly to have just until I could get new set after researching. (The kitchen aid knives were not worth taking with us on our move.) Well after using these for 6 months, I haven't even had second thoughts about ordering a new set! I absolutely love these! They're sharp, the handles are durable, and the set itself has just about all the variation I need. I only had to buy one other knife separate from the set at a local store just to fit my personal chopping preferences. If you're a young married couple looking for a nice set at a great price, this is the one for you. They hold up SO well and I don't have one single complaint about them.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2016",

But I can't quite afford to drop that much on a knife block (came with 8 knives I think). So compared to all the other budget knife block sets (Farberware, Chicago Cutlery, Cuisinart, etc.), these seem to top all of them in quality and value. I haven't had an issue with them yet and have had them for about 2 months now. I have not sharpened them yet. I've heard from lots of knives that they rust. I have mostly washed and dried them immediately after using and haven't had issues (yet, knock on wood). Definitely would make a great housewarming gift.Pros:-Price-Staying sharp so far-Generous 18 pieces-Full tang-Comfortable grip-Cuts well-Good variety of bladesCons:-Nothing important-Really the only thing I would want would be to have branded knives but I don't want some hideous Amazon Basics logo on my knife set so I'm good, not that the quality is shameful, which AB is actually very good usually##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2017",

The problem, as far as I can tell, is really soft steel.  They were dull out of the box, but I sharpened them.  It seemed to take a long time to get an edge.  A week later they needed sharpened again.  They look so nice, I thought it was me, so I bought a Smith sharpener.  I could not get an edge on these with the smith sharpener. I did notice a large pile of metal shavings,  More than anything I've ever sharpened. So I went back to the stone, and I got a decent edge.  Dull again, in about 3 days...  I will not accept defeat, so I bought a relatively expensive Lansky sharpening kit -4 steps.  I can only get a decent edge on Amazon knives with the medium diamond hone.  Chop a pound of carrots on a bamboo cutting board and the edge is gone.  I can put a razor edge on Gerber knives with the fine diamond hone and it lasts... To put things in perspective the  last full set of knives that I bought, were ""As seen on TV  Ginsu""-  $35 set lasted 20 years and they were sharp!

I find that I really use one of the middle sized knives primarily but there is a really great selection of blades in this package. I looked around hard for a knife set when I bought these and nothing compared. The expensive sets had fewer knives, a big name and price and the cheaper sets were just too cheap. I took a shot with these and don't regret the purchase. I would buy them again in a heartbeat. The price is good and the quality is great!p.s.

160,Jerret,Mediocre Knife Set,"Well, let’s start with this. The base does have saw dust when it arrives so please be sure to clean it before putting your knives through it. Also, some of the knives had finger print marks on the blade and has bad machining around the base of the blade where the handle meets. They don’t feel cheap, but also not premium. Definitely mediocre. For the price? Hopefully they will hold up for a year till I find a better set. But for the price, they will get you by as of now. Possibly better options for the price point? Either way, I’ll give it a go and update my review in a few months. Only giving it 3 stars bc the poor machining, finger prints on some of the blades, dusty wood block, and lack of being clean when arrived (meaning the prints look like from machine oil if that makes sense).

They are most likely not the best set you can buy on the market as they are MADE IN CHINA as illustrated on the box, and while some of the world's best kitchen knives come out of Solingen,Germany for the average home chef, these AmazonBasics will do the job more then fine. Comparable to what is in the market, for the price they can't be beat! They all have a good weight, balance and feel in your hand.  So far initially they are very sharp and have all the good traits of a higher quality knife-full tang (metal goes all the way to the end of handle), three solid rivets, and the fact that where the handle meets the blade there is a thick chunk of steel so that food and bacteria can't get stuck in between.

This is similar in feel and weighting, and that is all good, and it has a nice professional feel, but the steel of the blade is just not that great. The blades are thin enough to bend easily (if you are purposely trying to) and they don't hold an edge great, but most steel doesn't.That being said, it's a decent price and a decent knife set.

The knives felt weighted differently than I was used to and I had to adjust to handling them, especially the two largest knives, when chopping. Slicing is easy with any knife except the bread knife. These knives sharpen easily to a good edge but they dull pretty quickly, in my experience. Lastly, the paring knife snapped at the shank when I was using it to insert garlic cloves into a roast after sixteen months since purchase. Replacement window closed four months ago so I am out a paring until I buy a new one myself.Would I recommend? Sure, for the price, with caveats listed.Edit: By the way, I am still using these knives, daily, two years on. They hold an edge, cut nicely, and have a nice range of uses.

217,Julia,These are so much better than I expected!,"I ordered these because they were cheap and had mostly decent reviews, but I was not expecting anything special. But, these are so amazing for the price! They're not thin or flimsy, as one review noted, and they're already sharp, but even come with a working sharpening rod. The set has everything I could need, and for $25, they're so much better than I ever thought my first set of knives would be. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the heavy box.Update: I have had these knives for over a year and they are still holding up incredibly well. The paring knife got slightly rusty because it got put back into the knife block when it was still wet, but I was able to get the rust off with a baking soda mixture (pinterest). I still love this purchase.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 22, 2015",
218,jiherdy,I have now been using them for over 2 months and I am so happy we ordered this set,"I was a little skeptical at first since the price is well below that of high quality knife sets and they are also much lighter. I have now been using them for over 2 months and I am so happy we ordered this set. I used to have cheap and thin knives that felt like they would break when we would cut through tough things like steak. These knives make cutting and slicing anything a breeze and I now actually love that they're so light. I don't make much bread so I can't say much about the bread knife, but I'm sure it's as amazing as the other ones. I especially love that it comes with a sharpener that is stored with the rest of the knives, and the whole thing does not take up much space. I regret not getting it sooner.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 28, 2015",

I have been looking at knife sets for 2 years & every time I saw a nice one in the $100-$200 price range, I would read a few negative reviews to give me pause. Then I saw this set.....super low price & very good reviews. I figured it was worth the risk. It's not a high-end set forged in the fires of Mordor but for the price, it is as good as any lower end Henckels or competing sets you see in stores. The knives are crazy sharp. I've nicked myself a few times being a little careless. Can't speak to longevity & life all knives....it demands handwashing. But I absolutely love them.

For the steak knives alone this set would be worth it; I'm glad to have a carving knife as well. The only single flaw in the product is a low quality wood block, which I anticipated based on several other reviews here. On my block some slots in the steak knife tier were too narrowly cut to fit the blades and needed to be routed out with a Dremel. Despite that one issue, I'm still rating this set as five stars because the knives are well balanced, very sharp, and this set has every shape and size I want at the ready in my kitchen.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2016",

It was nice to also see that the knife block only had a label on the back.

Minus one star because the block angle is too vertical. If the block is placed under standard height cabinets, you won't be able to pull out the longer knives. We have to move the block out from under the cabinets to get the knives out. Suggestion to Amazon... angle the block a bit more.

230,crownjules,"They're knives, not great quality",I've had these knives a little over 1.5 years now.  I cook at home and use these for meal prep 3-4 times a week on average.They're knives so there's not much to them.  They're very lightweight and I prefer a heftier feel especially on the larger knives.  They're made in China using cheap Chinese steel so the quality is subpar.  This shows up in the fact that the blades dull much quicker then a quality knife set would.  So if you're buying a knife set for regular use then go with a name brand that's known for quality.  Unless you don't mind the fact that you will need to sharpen the knives more often.  If you're an infrequent cook then you could get by using these.##,3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019",

They come with a sharpening steel, so learn how to use it (there are a few video's on YouTube which show you how to do this without removing a finger), and use it every time you finish using a knife.

The steak knives do not cut as well as the cheaper knives they replaced - not sure it is an issue with sharpness, perhaps more of a blade design effect. The smaller knives of the set are not sharp enough and I have not been able to sharpen them to a perfect state either. The blades feel to thick and the balance is off for the smaller ones... The larger knives are fine - I don't have any issues with them.For the price this set may be OK but I find myself using the Amazon knives only if I cannot get a hold of my older knives.

290,Amazon Customer,If you're looking for a good knife set and happen to see this one in ...,"They work well. That's really all I have to say. You do have to sharpen them often if you want to keep them well, and maybe that's standard with knives of this price range. I haven't used particularly expensive knives on a regular basis, so I'm not sure how long those last before they need to be sharpened again.If you're looking for a good knife set and happen to see this one in your price range, go for it. This is not an outrageous deal though because I don't think the knives are any better than the KitchenAid ones I owned before. Again, if you sharpen them quite often then yes, they're sharp.

301,Michael D. Carpenter,Good price for okay knives.,"I’ve come to expect excellence in “Amazon Basics,” because the cables always seemed good.  But the name isn’t “Amazon Premium,” it's “Amazon Basics.”  These are not premium knives. As an earlier reviewer said, they ARE balanced, but they are lighter than premium knives, because they are thinner than premium knives. The chef's knife in my old set of Calphalon knives weighs 300 grams (after countless paper wheel sharpening / lightening sessions over many years), while the chef's knife in this new set is 225 grams- that's 25% lighter.  The chef knife's spine is obviously, visibly thinner in this new set.  This deal represents decent price for okay knives.##",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2017",

I've also noticed spots of discoloration on the metal, despite them being advertised as stainless steel.

Therefore, I can't keep I on the counter underneath the cabinet, next to my other knife set, toaster, etc. It now takes up working space.

I received a Sabatier set as a gift that was twice as much and frankly, these 'basic' knives are clearly better.My only complaint is the shears that are designed to come apart, they can accidentally come loose if opened too far.  Other than that, each knife and the block are a huge plus for starters needing a quality set of knives.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017",
363,Tigress74,Pleasantly surprised by the quality of these knives,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these knives. I was expecting low quality but somewhat sturdy equivalent  to what I would probably get in Walmart or Target for this price.  What I got was high quality and sturdy knives for the price. I tested them out with my marathon cooking for Thanksgiving. I was sold after cutting up several medium sized rutabaga. If you've ever cut rutabaga you know how grueling that can be. I'd highly recommend these knives if you are on a budget and need a good set of knives.##,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2015",
364,Kindle Customer,Great!,"I bought a house and wanted a nice knife set for my new kitchen.  This had great reviews and the price was right.  I think all the other reviews cover the attributes well, but I appreciate that this has a variety of knives and they are sharp!  They're great and I would highly recommend them.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2019",

366,Paula,18 piece knife set with 17 slots,"The whole knife set is great! The block is attractive and the knives are sharp and work well. My only concern is that we were sent a defective knife block, only 17 slots! It's missing an area underneath the sharpener. It doesn't affect the look of it much, just have to find space for the 18th knife in a drawer.##",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2017",
367,Joel Eagelston,Good Knives at a Reasonable Price,"Our previous knife set was growing rusty because of my boneheaded decision to repeatedly wash the knives in the dishwasher, so I decided to buy a replacement set. These knives are sharp, comfortable to hold, and look great in our kitchen. Just make sure you buy a knife cleaner at the same time, as these are to be hand-washed only. This knife set is highly recommended!##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2018",
368,Pamela Stock,These knives are great. I looked at a lot of knife sets ...,"These knives are great. I looked at a lot of knife sets and decided to take a chance on these. The price was so reasonable and they had gotten good reviews. They are have a good weight, they are sharp right out of the box, they have good balance and feel to them. For the price I got a set that was better than some priced at 3-4 times the cost.  Great starter set.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2018",

370,67 mustang,Great for a new homeowner,Purchased these for my new place. You can tell these are made at a price point. The steak knives and scissors are very handy. The chefs knife doesn't have a whole lot of weight to it but everything in this set is usable. Haven't had any issues with these rusting yet.##,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2017",
371,A&A,Excellent knives at a great value,"We bought these inexpensive knives for our cabin. We have nicer (expensive) knives we use at home, but my wife prefers these! They feel great in the hand, are nice and sharp and hold an edge well. Overall a great value for a basic block set and I'd highly recommend them.##",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020",

374,Miduckhunter,Needed a little work,The wood block needed a little cleaning up. The wood storage block was finished sanded on flat edges. But the slots for the storage of the steak knifes was very ruff and some would not fit. Had to clean the block up.##,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2018",

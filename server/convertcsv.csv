1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product Ever. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2023",If I could have given Zero (0) I most definitely would. The color was the only thing good about this product. It’s was missing screws and screw hole. The cat condo part had to be attached to the flat part and the 3 holes that were supposed to be in the cat condo wasn’t even there as you can see in the picture. I immediately returned the next day. I do not recommend this product. Save your money and for a few extra dollars get a better higher quality product. I went to my local pet store and bought one today for $60 more. It was well worth it too.,true,Pierre M.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Small cats only,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023","This cat condo is slim even though it appears sturdy. There are two errors in the instructions. 1. Box 6. They indicate that screw W1 is to be used. However, there were only five W1s in the packet but two W3s. The W3 fits this instruction. 2. Box 7. The instructions indicate the rope insert to be turned clockwise. It won't screw in unless it is turned counterclockwise.My kitty weighs 8 lbs. This structure is a fit with no wiggle room. The area that holds the box in content ""D"" would be better suited for jumping cats if the area outside the box were just a few inches longer.",true,Bumps

The tower perches are cardboard fitted onto a plastic base.  Is it any wonder that both towers are now leaning and close to collapse.  I will no longer buy anything sold as ""Amazon Basics.""

I love the beige color that flows with my neutral/boho home decor. The material is super soft and all of the poles have rope to scratch. It was easy to assemble as I was able to do it myself. I have one cat that is 7lbs & this works well for him. The shorter one is a little wobbly and might not work well for a heavier cat.,true,Jennifer Davis

The box it came in said +/-42 pounds and that sounds right because it was heavy when I brought it inside. I opened it and was happy to find all parts labeled. A bag of screws and Allen wrench were not but after flipping to the back of the booklet, I found the assembly directions and which screws went where. The instructions could be a bit clearer, but it wasn't terribly hard to put together. It was a gift so I didn't really know what the finished product would look like, so that may have been part of it. It seems sturdy and he's over the moon excited to check it out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Cat Tree!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022","We'd been shopping for some time at the local pet store for a larger cat tree but not finding one that seemed to fit the needs of our two cats. They were also extremely expensive. After extensive shopping on Amazon and other websites I settled on this tree, and I'm so glad I did. The price was probably half of what we were looking at in the pet store, looks much better, and it's large enough and strong enough to withstand our cats jumping on and off of it. I was concerned that it might be too large for our living room but it worked out perfectly. The cats are crazy about it. It might require some checking and tightening from time to time. Very highly recommended!",true,Karen Cooper

We looked at the measurements and it all seemed to line up with the last one we bought no problemo.Assembly for these is straight forward as always. Little diagram pics with corresponding letters to each piece, put screw here, put sisal leg there, badda bing badda boom, cat tree. Only one problem.The lower tower you see in the picture here, comes out from the rest of the tower about 2 inches from the base. Which basically means if you plan on pushing this whole thing up against a wall, and are expecting there to be 2 more inches of clearance between say, the tower and a couch leg, or what have you, the lower tower will push the entire thing out because it does not sit flush with the base of the whole tree. Incredibly annoying, but for the price i paid i'm not about to pack the thing back up and send it for a refund. All we ended up doing was just keeping the leg and tower disassembled and assembled the rest of it. Works just as good, and now we have a couple replacement pieces for the taller tower should they get destroyed sooner. Not terrible, but they should really make a note of that in the description.",true,David J

5.0 out of 5 stars,great cat trees,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2022","My 2nd AmazonBasics cat tree is as good as the first -- straightforward assembly, scratch posts one cat loves, platforms the other cat enjoys. Great for my older cats, but young cats would enjoy it even more.You can leave off parts you don't intend to use from all of these trees, for a cleaner look. Kitties like to transition from surface to surface, so putting this next to a desk or another cat tree encourages playfulness (you can see I have another platform next to this one in my photo). The dangling toys are also toss-able if you don't want them on the tree. The cat in the picture loves to chase them.Like with all cat trees, how each kitty uses it will vary. For average sized cats, I think this style (with posts about 18"" tall) is preferable, the posts on smaller versions are too short. See the product photos that diagram the size.The only drawback? There's a LOT of versions of these in different sizes, and prices and availability seem to vary a lot. Fewer models in stock consistently would be preferable...

I also wanted something that was practical, sturdy and allowed my adult cat to look out the window and my two kittens somewhere to climb and play. It was so hard finding a tower that had large enough platforms that would allow an adult cat enough space to lounge and sleep and not just perch. This tree had it all. It was easy to assemble. The color is very neutral and doesn’t draw attention. It doesn’t wobble at all and the perches are well supported. My three cats fell in love right away. They like the toys that come attached and the kittens climb the scratch posts frequently while playing. Mama kitty loves the tall perches to sleep and I like how they have rims so they can sleep without worrying about falling off.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Why this is the best bet.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2022","Most young big cats love heights and are fearless about attaining them--unless the height proves ""tipsy.""

I was overly impressionable to photos of floor to ceiling ""cat trees"" without noticing that the base was no larger or heavier than the 3-4 platforms above it.  Certain disaster--not to your cat but to your ego, patience and even pocket-book.  Of course, you can try to secure the top of the tree to your ceiling BUT: 1. your cat may have made up it's mind re: the earlier instability of the tree; 2. your ceiling may not appreciate the drilling needed for a secure fastening; 3. secure or not, the weight of a 4-5 platform tree will eventually defeat the ceiling anchor.While this Amazon tree is not tip-proof, it's: 1. made for large cats; 2. it's tall but not to an excessive degree; 3. the base is wide enough to supply stability that's totally lacking in trees that make no distinction in the size of platforms.",true,Samuel

Unfortunately, as another reviewer mentioned, even after tightening the posts maximally, they still wobble. My cats are small to average size - 8 and 10 lbs. The cats didn't seem to mind, but after 7 months this led to the post with the second platform breaking off, and now my cats no longer use the tree because they can't get up to the top platform.

But my adult cats have a hard time maneuvering from the second to third, and third to fourth platform/step. The area to actually jump is too small for them to maneuver around, and the height is enough between steps that they need that extra maneuvering space. My 10 lb. cat, who is well versed in climbing and has no issues with heights, tried to jump to the third step and clung to the side looking like Mufasa. I think extra space for the platforms would've gone a long way to make this actually usable for a cat larger than 8 pounds. The product itself is fine, the end product is a little odd looking because the steps are small, but the materials seem good quality.

That ball toy is a favorite for him and he often bats it while sitting on the circle rung (even though it's right under him).  He's used every one of the scratching posts frequently as well.  The only aspects of the product he hasn't used much are the long piece of string and the ladder/hole, which seem to be designed more for small cats/kittens, so him not using them isn't exactly a problem.The product was obviously sent in a box with all the pieces separate and quality instructions on how to assemble it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,A waste of money,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2021","This cat tree is, unfortunately, a complete waste of money.  It was very easy to put together and once it was assembled it felt quite sturdy.  My cats loved it so I thought I had hit a home run for them.  Here we are, five months later, and what I have is a carpeted piece of junk.On Amazon's picture you can see that the highest platform is flat but there is a cover that goes on with elastic which turns it into a bed with soft raised edges.  After a couple of months that platform started to wobble.  As you can see on Amazon's picture, it is attached to a box underneath it,  That attachment is a screw which screws the post onto the top of the box.  No amount of turning would tighten it back up so I just hoped for the best.The other day I finally heard the inevitable crash and went running in to find the platform and post had fallen off.  Once that happened I was able to see that the screw which attaches the post to the box is threaded into a piece of black plastic.  That piece of plastic is simply stapled to the scratching post.  If you look at my picture, you can see the round piece of black plastic on top of the box (ignore the post behind it, that's a separate tower).  The middle of that piece of plastic is threaded to hold the screw.  That connection is still strong, but the plastic goes inside the bottom of the scratching post and that is where it is attached with nothing but staples.  It's no wonder that the cats' frequent jumping on and off put lateral pressure on the staples until they finally lost their hold on the post.Now the second highest (flat) platform is starting to do the exact same thing.  I guess I could buy a staple gun and re-staple it, but even if I put twice as many staples in I'm not very confident that it won't end up doing the exact same thing.  What I'm left with is the base, a couple of scratching posts, and a box that sits about 2' off the ground which the cats can hide in--except they don't particularly care for that part.I'm sure all of these 5 and 4 star reviews are from people who haven't had this thing long enough to experience the loose and wobbly platforms, or ones that never bothered to come back and change their reviews.  If you decide to take a chance and buy this anyway, just make sure it's not next to anything that can get broken when these two pieces fall off.  That's ""WHEN"" and not ""if"".",true,Cheryl

The reviews looked pretty good for this but overall after owning this for several months it has been a bad purchase. The cat tree was pretty simple to assemble but even during assembly it was kind of iffy if the quality would hold up based on other reviews. The standalone circular(not the bed) wobbles very badly. My cat has been using it less and less and is very cautious to go onto the circular pad. Very disappointed in this product.Edit: This is poorly crafted and the standalone circular broke at the leg.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for bigger cats,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021","I originally got this for my smaller 8 pound cat, but while this was being shipped to my home, I adopted another 10 pound cat. He's a solid kitty. The stairs would suffice for my smaller cat, but the stairs seem unsteady when my bigger cat is on them. The bed area also feels like cardboard wrapped in the faux fur material, so not very sturdy. For the price, I'd put my money towards something more sturdy if you have a larger cat.",true,PeachyPerson

A older cat ( over like 10-14 pounds) wouldn’t be very comfortable bc the platforms and beds are slightly on the smaller side , to me.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as overwhelming as our previous kitty skyscraper...,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2021","This is a very nicely designed cat abode. The instructions, such as they are, could have been clearer, but we are all used to those IKEA-like stick picture guides.  My two boys have not quite taken to it yet but they might just be expressing their displeasure with the downsizing as their previous cat tree was a bit overwhelming for our space.  My main complaint is that the ""X-large size"" claim, which I assume was meant to describe the condo, is smaller than I'd expected and my big-boned 15-pounder can barely squeeze in; luckily, most felines enjoy being in close quarters. So I'd say that this is not perfect but is very good, especially for the price.",true,Catabolist

My cats love this tree stand and are on it almost 80% of the time, but unfortunately the platforms are very unstable. The tallest one would lean to one side from the time we set it up, and after 4 months it has completely separated from the base and fallen off --- while my cat was lying on it too. I would likely not purchase again and look for a tall cat stand with more sturdiness.",true,Courtney Edgecomb

This ""Cat "" tree is more for kittens, not even for smaller cats like we have.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Best $60 Ive ever spent......(changed my mind),"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021","My kitty LOVES this cat tree. She's on it most of the day. Putting it together was easy except the stairs were a little tricky. Its sturdy for one cat or maybe a bunch of kittens. Two full grown cats playing will probably move it. I'm happy with my purchase. Keeps more fur on the tree instead of my furniture.UPDATED 4/8/22I think this cat tree should have lasted longer than 8 months. It is now garbage. My cat is not rough on it at all, in fact she's is declawed (before I adopted her). The lower platform cannot be tightened any further and its so loose I was afraid she would fall off, so now I need to replace it. I do not recommend it any more. Very disappointed.",true,deevee
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for a year,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021","I bought this for my cat in June 2020 and it has lasted until Sep 2021. After about a year it started to lean and joints became loose. Now when my cat jumps on it or sleeps on the top tier, It leans dramatically and sometimes she falls off when she rolls over (she lands on her feet so don't worry) I tried to tighten them but there was no use. My cat LOVED this tree, probably why it's falling apart now.I'm probably not going to buy again because I wished it lasted longer/was sturdier, especially because I replaced the sisal rope just a few months ago. BUT I am going to keep this in the back of my mind incase my cat hates the new tree I get her. She was obsessed.",true,Sara

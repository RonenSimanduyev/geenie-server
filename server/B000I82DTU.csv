0,KarahCrisis,Maybe run a pinch small,"These are exactly as described. My only issue is, they are awfully tight. I'm usually a small in most gloves, but these are tighter. I have very little hands. Other than that, they are comparable to quality of the ones I have used from the oncology unit for my son who needs latex free. They were packaged nicely, box in fine shape upon receipt and very durable. They beyond serve their purpose. Next time I'll get a medium. They're still usable, so I'm not totally complaining. Just trying to help out with sizing. You may need to go with size up.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023",

I purchased the Medium size due to the requests (or demands :-) ) of the females in our household.  Per Comfy''s size guide, the Medium gloves can also fit many Large hands. So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

I am very disappointed due to the fact that I have to wear them with all day while taking care of my patients.

210,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

As, soon as I tore open the plastic wrapping the boxes came in, I could begin to smell something strange. When I tore open the box, the odor came at me strong and it spread throughout the room.  Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure?

I took one to work to mic it - they are 2 mil.Now, I am keeping them because of the reasons with which I opened this review, and because a thinner glove allows you to feel what you're doing better than a thick one (great for more detailed automotive work).

I purchased the Medium size due to the requests (or demands :-) ) of the females in our household.  Per Comfy''s size guide, the Medium gloves can also fit many Large hands. So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove. Either way, the gloves are durable and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 23, 2022",

710,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

As, soon as I tore open the plastic wrapping the boxes came in, I could begin to smell something strange. When I tore open the box, the odor came at me strong and it spread throughout the room.  Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure?

So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove. Either way, the gloves are durable and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 23, 2022",

1202,Nicky Bell,Will not be buying these again due to the horrific smell,I like that my hands don’t get wet why wearing them like some gloves. I dislike VERY much the terrible sulphur smell that these gloves have and my hands still smell like that even after washing with warm soapy water. I have purchased these gloves in the past and have never had this problem. I have recently purchased 4 boxes and upon opening them EVERY box smells like sulphur. I am very disappointed due to the fact that I have to wear them with all day while taking care of my patients. My patients have even said they could smell them and for an elderly person that can’t  smell as good as younger folks that’s saying a lot. Please advise me on what to do as I am not happy with these gloves at all,3.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 20, 2022",

1210,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

1710,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

2210,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure?

I took one to work to mic it - they are 2 mil.Now, I am keeping them because of the reasons with which I opened this review, and because a thinner glove allows you to feel what you're doing better than a thick one (great for more detailed automotive work).

I purchased the Medium size due to the requests (or demands :-) ) of the females in our household.  Per Comfy''s size guide, the Medium gloves can also fit many Large hands. So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

2710,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

When I read that review, I said, ""sure, right, uh huh"" and ordered, because I've used this brand before. As, soon as I tore open the plastic wrapping the boxes came in, I could begin to smell something strange. When I tore open the box, the odor came at me strong and it spread throughout the room.  Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure?

These gloves are NOT 4 mil.  It was obvious when I pulled the first one from the box and could literally see my hand through it before putting it on.  I took one to work to mic it - they are 2 mil.Now, I am keeping them because of the reasons with which I opened this review, and because a thinner glove allows you to feel what you're doing better than a thick one (great for more detailed automotive work).  I just don't like it when sellers lie to people, hence the review.  You have been informed.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022",

I purchased the Medium size due to the requests (or demands :-) ) of the females in our household.  Per Comfy''s size guide, the Medium gloves can also fit many Large hands. So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove. Either way, the gloves are durable and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 23, 2022",

3210,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

Actually, I can't say exactly what they smell like, I can't pin it down, maybe rubber and poop? When I read that review, I said, ""sure, right, uh huh"" and ordered, because I've used this brand before. As, soon as I tore open the plastic wrapping the boxes came in, I could begin to smell something strange. When I tore open the box, the odor came at me strong and it spread throughout the room.  Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure? If there was anything wrong, I expected it to be that they were torn or tore easily or something like that. Anyway, I had to put them outside. Please don't order these if you have children at home.

So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

3710,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these). If I had to guess I would guess 1 mil.SAVE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU JUST WANT THEM FOR ON/OFF AT THE GAS PUMP or something similarly quick and unlikely to rip them.",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022",

I purchased the Medium size due to the requests (or demands :-) ) of the females in our household.  Per Comfy''s size guide, the Medium gloves can also fit many Large hands. So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

4210,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

4710,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure?

I took one to work to mic it - they are 2 mil.Now, I am keeping them because of the reasons with which I opened this review, and because a thinner glove allows you to feel what you're doing better than a thick one (great for more detailed automotive work).

I purchased the Medium size due to the requests (or demands :-) ) of the females in our household.  Per Comfy''s size guide, the Medium gloves can also fit many Large hands. So I purchased only Mediums and tried them on my Large hands. They did fit and covered the palm of my hand extending about an inch past the edge. This is okay for my use and saves additional money buying only one size. But if you are using liquids (cleaning, washing, mopping, etc.) you may want to buy the Large gloves also. That will extend more past the edge of your hand, lowering the possibility of getting liquids under the glove.

5210,Leah 💛,Kitchen trash bags are thicker than these! (?1mil?),"Nowhere in the description, here or manufacturers website, did I find a specification of the thickness. I took a chance and ordered because my previous brand - regular ol' painters gloves (if they're not sealed and labeled as medically sterile, they're painters gloves in my opinion) that were about 4mil - had increased substantially in price. I wanted thicker because the 4mil do rip at the cuffs easily when putting on/pulling off with too much force and a sliver of a natural fingernail will slit the tips super easily, often). These are ***maybe*** 3 mil (do they make 1 mil because I feel certain my trash bags are more durable than these).

Actually, I can't say exactly what they smell like, I can't pin it down, maybe rubber and poop? When I read that review, I said, ""sure, right, uh huh"" and ordered, because I've used this brand before. As, soon as I tore open the plastic wrapping the boxes came in, I could begin to smell something strange. When I tore open the box, the odor came at me strong and it spread throughout the room.  Back they go. A lot of things have changed during this pandemic. Companies change how they manufacture. I am not sensitive to odors or chemicals and can take a lot. So, I don't know what's up with these gloves, but the off-gassing is ""really, really"" bad. They are just gloves, go figure? If there was anything wrong, I expected it to be that they were torn or tore easily or something like that. Anyway, I had to put them outside. Please don't order these if you have children at home.

These gloves are NOT 4 mil.  It was obvious when I pulled the first one from the box and could literally see my hand through it before putting it on.  I took one to work to mic it - they are 2 mil.Now, I am keeping them because of the reasons with which I opened this review, and because a thinner glove allows you to feel what you're doing better than a thick one (great for more detailed automotive work).  I just don't like it when sellers lie to people, hence the review.  You have been informed.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 21, 2022",

While I do not eat them, I have to say that they taste absolutely GREAT based on the reactions from our canine roommates.Every box arrives sealed, it's contents fresh and crunchy. The smell brings back memories from the mid to late 80's, so I am certain the recipe is as good as always.The dogs send their gratitude and thanks, along with a little bit of slobber.

I tried the ones with chew bones and chicken wrapped and they loved those but wasn't crazy about what might be in the bones.  Milk Bones have been a staple for years so decided to try wrapping these in chicken strips to dehydrate.  What a perfect treat.  They can't gobble them up in one bite so they at least taste what they are eating and also the benefit of chewing the bone for their teeth....it's super easy to make these and my little dogs love them....This big box will keep them in treats for months so great deal for the cost",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2022",VINE VOICE

I kept it anyhow, my dog thinks they are still great.The large bones are around 4-5” long.  If your dog is over 80 lbs I suggest the extra large ones.I have never found a dog that turned these down.Delivery people are known to keep a box in their carts.My 80 lb youngster loves these.  She knows where they are stored and will often sit by the box looking at me with pleading eyes.My older dog has pancreatitis- finding treats for her can be difficult.If your dog has that condition is as important to know what not buy as what to buy.BOTH CALCIUM and FAT can set off an attack. These have loads of calcium, so they are off limits. Try to find VERY low fat chicken treats without calcium for that condition.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2022",

Her teeth are perfectly white though. She'd spent 11 months in the shelter. She was instantly Mama's little girl @ 6 yrs old. Our 2 put down were very yippy. Stella doesn't make a noise. Only one bark as a warning. She also knows when we order pizza, giving us her one, warning bark. We loveWe didn't know about needed oral care other than give her soft treats + human food.Now we know better, buying expensive grocery store treats + our, human food.Now Stella has the whitest teeth. Besides feeding her Milk Bones + every treat now is good for her.But what really whiteness her teeth was a dog water additive. One capfull per pint of water. We actually found her teeth getting whiter almost immediately. She's spoiled crazy here. Lots of toys, love + treats. She doesn't like other dogs so knew she'd need $3000 fencing ASAP.She loves her new yard + us. We were told no 2nd dog with her.

5640,Dawn Maynor,My 4 Dogs All-Time Favorite 'Snack Food',"Ohhh- milk bones. What do you put in your products, Milk-Bone?! Because my dogs just can't get enough! I have three malamute mixes and a pitbull. Three of my four dogs are not picky eaters what-so-ever, but one of my dogs is a downright queen when it comes to her food. She needs everything 'just perfect' and will stick her nose up to most foods I try to feed her. Milk bones, though? She'll never turn up her nose to a milk bone! And that's saying a lot- because she rarely eats anything.So what exactly are 'milk bones'? Well, they're a dog treat comprised of mostly grain, some meat by products, and ya- a little bit of milk (which I'm guessing is where they got their name). Do they offer any nutritional value for your dog? Very little. And they're definitely not something that should be a main part of your dog's diet. But as a small daily treat, they're great. Look at them in the same way you'd look at cookies for a human. Are they great? No. But they're totally fine in moderation. These milk bones are shaped just like a bone and come in different sizes and flavors. I all of the sizes and all of the flavors. My dogs love every single on of them, but for this specific purchase I bought the 'Medium' original flavor in the 10 pound box. The box is HUGE and there are a good 200 or so bones inside. Great for multi-dog families!The bones are durable and crunchy. A perfect way to help clean your dogs teeth by removing plaque and debris that make be stuck between teeth near the gums. Hard crunchy snacks act as a natural tooth brush for dogs and milk bones are the perfect crunchy texture to 'scrape away' unwanted remnants left from canned and soft foods. The bones are so hard that they don't break apart in transit. These hold up exceptionally well being shipped and very few (I'd say about 2%) of the bones in my huge box were broken. Almost all of them were in perfect condition.My' picky eater' pup loves these and I use them while training her. My other three dogs also adore these- but aren't quite as picky of eaters so their opinion isn't as quite as meaningful. I'm a huge fan of Milk-Bone. Their products are made in the USA and are always top quality. They're a trusted brand that I continue to return to time and time again- and for good reason. My dogs love these treats. I love these treats. And in terms of 'snacks bars for pets' - milk bones take the cake (pun intended).",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2016",

5687,Careful Shopper,Good Enough For Molly,"Milk Bone dog biscuits are second only to things-she-should-never-eat in Mollie's pantheon of treats.  For some reason we humans can never comprehend, my very  doggy 57 pound, two year old, lab mix, prefers day-old  recently used dog food  as her snack of choice.  Our neighborhood is a cafeteria despite the law. As soon as she is let off leash in Central Park she makes a beeline for the nearest pile as regular as the clockwork.  ""Leave it"" screamed in a rising voice only works after her tasting has started.  At home, I have offered her a selection of Zuke's treats, smelly cheese, freeze dried liver, and sometimes, a lick of the knife I just used to spread peanut butter.  If I hold the treat in one hand and a milk bone in the other, most of the time she ignores the treat and gently takes the Milk Bone.  It doesn't matter if I have broken the Milk Bone and the size is small.  She has no discrimination based on size, just smell.In my Upper West Side neighborhood, here in NYC, the sidewalks are crowded with dogs.  Most, like mine, seem to be rescues, but many are show quality, and we owners congregate in the local dog run and talk about, what else, dogs.Tooth cleaning around here with general anesthesia can push four figures and is a popular procedure with dogs that eat home cooked food, ""raw diet"" diets, gourmet refrigerated pet food etc.  My Molly has been raised on Blue Buffalo dry food in various flavors, and we always have a ten pound box of Milk Bones hands.  When she cleans up her plate, or does a reasonably good job, she is rewarded with a Milk Bone.  They are a wonderful training aid and can be broken in small pieces so you don't overfeed.  The point is that my Molly has shiny white teeth and a sweet breath and has never been fed table scraps or gourmet foods.When using Amazon Prime, the Milk Bone comes in at half the price of buying locally.

I know they are from the biscuits because there are extra little holes in every biscuit where they burrowed out. I shook a couple live bugs out of a biscuit, too. Gross. Just gross. I've read that I can freeze them for a couple days, but I don't have that kind of freezer space. I could bake them, but that thought also grosses me out - will they start wriggling out of the biscuits as they die? YUCK... I guess I'm not too worried about my dogs eating them (they are real doggy dogs and will eat much worse things than that if I let them, but do I want to KNOW that I'm feeding them buggy biscuits every time I'm handing out biscuits, even if I did bake them to kill the bugs? Nope. Also, I'm not too thrilled with finding pill bugs everywhere as they try to infest my other foods. They even ended up in the fridge somehow and were still alive (just really slow)! Ugh.

Since I brought the product inside as soon as it was delivered, I can only assume the ants got in the box during transit.  But do not despair!  The solution is to ask Amazon to ship Milk Bones in an Amazon box, which they will do at no additional cost.  The Amazon shipping boxes are sealed in a more secure manner than shipping in the Milk Bones box only.  I have ordered Milk Bones many times before and they were shipped in Amazon boxes.

5746,Chaos & Coffee ,Training tools!!,"I have 5 dogs that fall into the medium dog category. I have recently started babysitting my brothers dog and he is young!! Teething, chewing, and getting into trouble all the time and adorable enough to get by with most of it.I keep these on hand for a bedtime cookie for my gang but right now we are going through these like kleenex during allergy season. He gets one in exchange for his no no chews. Every time he gives up an item he isn't supposed to have, or sits, or shakes, or potties outside, boom! A milkbone in the mouth! He doesn't get a whole one because I don't want him to explode. I think that would probably make the news and I don't need that hassle.These are perfect training tools. I break the ""ears"" off first and then break the body. They seem to break easier that way. They are very crumby though so don't do this in your bed. You will have crumbs in the bed until you change the sheets. They hide until you're comfortable and then suddenly the bed is covered in them.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020",

5748,Elizabeth,Great treat for ravenous eaters,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my roommate's dog. She is a hungry, hungry 2-year old pitbull mix. Most small treats she swallows whole and I always feel like she doesn't really appreciate the treat since she doesn't take time to savor it. These large treats are very crunchy and a good, sturdy size. They take her about 15 seconds to eat and then she snorts up the crumbs and then licks my hands clean of any lingering flavor. Much better than the 1 second it takes her to swallow a small treat. She really seems to love them. They are big enough that sometimes I break them in half and she still gets a decent sized treat.I may be acting a bit overprotective but since they are very hard bones and her first bite always breaks the bone into several choking sized pieces, I do make sure to watch her eat the entire bone so she doesn't try to swallow a hard/jagged piece whole and get it lodged in her throat. She seems to be smarter than that but I would definitely caution against giving this as a treat and then heading out the door for work before the dog finishes it. You never know. I do the same type of thing with my cats though so maybe I'm just overprotective in general.Since they are very large, dense and hard I would suggest only getting them for dogs that are both big and strong. If your dog COULD BE considered medium or is an older dog with a weaker jaw, you may want to try the smaller sized treats. For a strong jawed, energetic young pitbull, they are perfect.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2015",

 We have a 3 year old great pyrenees who we got from someone a year or so ago.  He is not only a wanderer, but being raised hands off, when he met our neighbors with young boys who scratched on him all the time, he kinda decided he likes them better.  We have asked them to shoo him back over here.  We live in the country, it is not as if they live close by.  We cannot even see their house.  So now, my husband says I am bribing the dog.  I said ... YES, I am.  The neighbors don't feed him so I have at least one thing up on them.  He comes home for dinner and if he comes home at others times, I give him these Milk Bones as treats.  We are starting to win the battle.  I would just throw my hands up at get rid of him all together, but he keeps the coyotes away for everyone.Anyway ... good price and value. Better then local grocery store prices.  Ample sized box could last 1-3 months for us.  Arrived super quick.  Good size for big dogs like Toby the Great Pyrenees.  They are 4"" long x 1-1.5"" wide.Would purchase again.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 15, 2016",VINE VOICE

5842,E. A. Piggott & Karen,"Best Size, Value and USA made. Dogs care!","I rescued a dog that was so picky she would only eat USA made food and treats because she said it mattered to be a patriotic dog!  Truly, she was picky and traumatized! Finicky in everything so I decided to use the mini-treats (always Milk Bone) so she didn’t get tubby as I trained her. (She was stubborn-smart to train) She would be playfully cute to distract me so I wouldn’t make her “come”. She would sit, lay, stay but not come! She still won’t without a very firm command!

I’ve read on here that people were finding bugs in these treats, but I have not experienced that. It would be very easy for insects to get into this box since it is only a box with treats thrown in it. I would love if they could put a plastic bag in this box before the treats to keep them protected from intruders.Once this box comes, I put all the treats in gallon ziplock bags (about three bags) to keep what freshness they have and also to keep intruders out. Since they come in 10 pound box, it takes us about a year to go though them with just our one good boy. We also break these treats in half to help our dogs weight and it’s easier for him to consume.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020",VINE VOICE

5919,KinIA,My dogs like them....but,"My dog loves them so good enough BUT.... not from Amazon but at xmas there was a really good buy and i got 5 boxes. Since I've had problems in the past with bugs (thinking from somewhere in my house), I wrapped them in garbage bags, separately. When I open a new box they go into an airtight container. I take out a pound at a time and put them in a smaller jar, easier to grab and my pups know both containers. I feel with the two airtight storage options that I would avoid those darn bugs. I got them again on the 4th box in the 4th month. I was so frustrated! I spoke with a friend who happens to be a vet in So Cal and they have had the same problem. The bugs are in THE BISCUITS!! This has happened several times and I would never have guessed that. So, only order 1 at a time and keep them stored properly or you will be as frustrated as I was/am. I should stop buying them but I like that they are hard and think they are good (as a treat can be) for their teeth. So ONE BOX AT A TIME and only small boxes if you have a smaller dog. Or better, don't buy so your dog won't ingest something live in some form.☆☆☆UPDATE☆☆☆ I have spoken with the Milk-Bone customer service and was offered no solution (but a coupon) or responsibility even though I repeated several times that I don't want coupons, I wanted answers. You decide if you want to support this product but with the tepid response both on the phone and in email, no more bones.FYI, this has happened on 2 different coasts, 3 times over 20+ years. It took my friend, the vet, to help me understand it was not me or anything I did OR anything to do with cleanliness, they're IN the biscuits at time of purchase. I hope this ends your guilt about getting bugs in your home, you're doing nothing wrong and your house is clean. And yes, I feel stupid for not realizing that the bones are infested but who would think that? Thank you my wonderful former veterinarian.Hope the pictures help.Search Milk-Bone Biscuits with bugs and see how many videos there are.

5931,By On By,Good deal on dog biscuits - but this box isn't re-closable.,"These seem to be just like the ones I have been buying in the grocery store, except at the grocery store I'm buying smaller boxes for more money.  My dog seems to approve of them - so this is definitely the better deal.I see that some other reviews mention these being overpriced or available for less elsewhere - but prices fluctuate on Amazon, so it's hard to know what these were priced at the time.  When I purchased these they were a great deal.The reason for only 4 stars is that this giant box doesn't have any inside bag or any other way to re-close the box. The box just comes taped shut with one piece of packing tape. It will take months for my dog to eat all of these, so it would be much better if there were some way to close the box back up.  I can't keep them in this box because they will get stale and could attract insects or mice.

She has not had any health problems or anything related to giving her these treats but that's just her and every dog is different so if you're trying them out for the first time make sure to watch how they react to them like any new foods.

5950,B. Renee,Perfect size. Healthy treats.,"When the box first arrived I was a little concerned since the box looked like it had just received a beating. I still decided to try the treats and I am so glad I did because my dogs absolutely loved them. I like how the biscuits are large so it keeps them busy for a while. My dogs are all about 40 lbs and these treats are perfect for them. I have tried other large biscuits in the past but they are too thin and easily break. These are thick and hard to break with my hands which means they keep my dogs busy for a slightly longer time. Each biscuit is about 125 calories which is a great way to add a few calories to my skinny dog's diet-- She is super active so she's on the thinner side. These also help keep dogs teeth clean because they are so crunchy. My dogs don't like having their teeth brushed so it's awesome to have treats that will help remove some of the tartar--Of course these don't replace frequent brushing, but they help. Oh, and they are made in the US!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2015",

I have not done much investigation on what it contains but my dog is eating these for over 2 years now and have no complaints so I believe all is well.One funny thing is that Amazon asked me to review the Flavor of them item.

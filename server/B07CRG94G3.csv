1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2023",When this device doesn’t crap out on you.. it runs great. I just went through the process twice of getting a new one through warranty. I only use it for games. Installed a few games that barely even touched the 2 tbs. And it still crapped out and stopped working and making weird noises and wouldn’t solve with troubleshooting. Good luck!,True,Kenzie Timmerman
1.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly don't if you should buy this,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2023","I'm just going to put this out here as someone who has NEVER seen a 2TB drive for less than around 110. Buyer beware. There are plenty of scammers allowed to operate on Amazon, and plenty of videos explaining how this can happen. Write speeds should remain consistent. If they start bogging down somewhere in the middle you should check your data to make sure it's all there and still works. Scammers have used SD cards and other cheaper memory sticks to give the appearance of a working drive. They mess with the firmware to get it to read a larger capacity, but you will have to physically open up the drive to confirm. The slow down comes from the device deleting older data and replacing it with the new files. As for the warranty, they will make it look official, but they will look for any reason not to refund as they do not intend to do so. The price this is being offered at is consistent with 1 TB drives, and most are often not even USB 3.0.",True,Derek Jones

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works Okay, Disconnects, and Not good quality","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023","I use this product for work to store files on. I've had it for a year now and I feel I can give a pretty good reivew. The storage space is wonderful. I love the compact size its easy to set up and basically set  it and forget it. I've had it on one spot for a whole year and I dont travel with it. It sits on my desk plugged into my computer. However, due to some sort of software or technical issues, I have not found the answer to as of yet, all I know is that it is not my computer's issue, its the hard drive's issue. Nothing is wrong on the computer end. But for some reason it likes to ""time out"" for lack of a better term. Randomly, and that's what's annoying about it, I could be using it for work and it just shuts off on me. Leaving me to unplug and replug. Several times a day. Nothing happens to it, it does it all on its own. Due to me unplugging and plugging back in so many times a day, obvioulsy the cord was going to wear. Well, this morning it took a bow and decided to not work anymore. So now I have a hardrive full of work files, that doesn't work anymroe because the cord now does not work. So, for over $50, I dont think this is a good product for the money. For over $50 I expect the device to work properly for one, and two, the cord should hold up  more than a phone charger holds up. Maybe its the plug design on the device. I dont know. But something needs to change, because this obviously isnt working. I'm disappointed in this product.",True,Tnawiecz

Now I have to go to an old to an old computer and put it together and see if I can get as much data as I can off there. Just explaining how much 8 TB is to a non-computer user is staggering.

5.0 out of 5 stars,This package is a fantastic deal!!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2023","The produce arrived on time.  I have already backed up tons of jpg pictures, home videos and I've hardly made a dent in the storage capacity.  I think the price for the amount of storage space is a great deal.  Hard to believe my first computer had an 8 GB hard drive. No typo- I did say ""eight"".  It was a HP desktop with a dial up modem and it ran on Windows 98.  I would reccomend this to a friend or family member.  It might be a lie if I say ""I would buy it again"" because at 63 this one will last the rest of my life!  Still hard to believe the cheap price for 2 terabytes of storage.  The unit is solid and looks well made. My ONLY complaint is the USB cable should be longer.  Buy one- you'll be satisfied!!!",True,Mark G.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Big photo storage for the home,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2023","I bought the 16TB unit with front USB hub to store photographs and some miscellaneous files. My unit is connected to a dual-boot (Windows 10 & Ubuntu) laptop workstation through a USB hub.After I connected the USB cable, I plugged in the drive's power cord and Seagate One Touch Hub fired right up. I moved 50,000 files, totaling about 500GB to the drive to confirm that everything was working, and then fired up Lightroom and had it 'add' a year's worth of pictures to it's catalog. Everything worked fine. I then booted up Ubuntu to confirm that Ubuntu could see and access the disk, and it did so without any issues.While I did not benchmark the unit, it's speed seemed typical of other hard drives. That is, while much slower than a SSD, is plenty fast enough for photo storage.The unit has only a very small disk activity LED on the front of the unit. There are no other lights on the unit. When you first add the unit to a Windows system, the drive will appear in the 'Desktop' view of the File Manager. Normally File Manager defaults to showing you the 'Quick Access' - Frequent Folders and Recent Files view.The unit isn't silent - no hard disk drive is - and it does make sounds when it's spinning the disk platters up to speed after 'sleeping' and when the disk is moving the disk heads to read or write a file. The rest of the time the unit is essentially silent. It's safe to say that this disk is nosier than any disk I've had before (it's also a LOT bigger than any disk I've had before), but the sounds this unit makes are no louder than everyday background office noises. Personally, I don't find them objectionable.I am pleased with the 16TB Seagate One Touch Hub I purchased. The unit is performing like I expected it to, and I expect it will serve me well for a number of years.",True,Doyle Grant

1.0 out of 5 stars,Hit or Miss,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2023","Sunny Chen states in his review ""They will either fail in the beginning or last a long time."" I'm represent the latter. In the matter of 3 mos, after storing nearly 8TB's of video data, my data became corrupted and after numerous tries with several sophisticated software applications, became unrecoverable. On some level, I believe the issues have more to do with its mechanical function as opposed to anything resembling a software problem. When I try to plug it in, it makes a lot of noise and will make normal independent computer functions/operations a nightmare.I felt a little apprehensive about purchasing it, but overlooked my standards when I saw the price drop. Broke a cardinal rule ...buy cheap ...you get cheap! Don't so much mine the financial loss, part of dealing in any electronic environment.

4.0 out of 5 stars,So 16TB is really only 14.5TB just know that.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2023","So people working in this industry likely know it already. But 16TB drives are not 16TB. They are not 15TB they are 14.5TB.  At least advertise it as 15 which is rounding up rather than 16 which is taking some liberties.  I don't care about the technical aspects about why this is simply advertise it correctly.  I likely would have purchased the size up from this if I knew I was loosing 1.5TB before I opened the box.  It does work great, it's size doesn't make it terribly portable I'd rather have the smaller 5tb drives for moving around.  I had 0 problems setting it up and using it.",True,rob lewis

I’ve read the reviews above and the majority of the comments and complaints stem from the device not getting recognized by their computer/laptop. Unfortunately I don’t feel that this is an error on the developers/ creators of product itself but rather an error on the packaging/ marketing team of the manufacturer. The device appears to work perfectly. There are 2 separate issues here. Is it the people who wrote the user instructions who are at fault? We’re they not clear on the steps needed to set the device up properly? OR is it the consumers who rushed to set up their device without taking the time to read the directions thoroughly before starting the setup process?? Quite often it’s a combination of the two where both parties blame the other; neither accepting any fault of their own.Just thought I would share that insight to those of you on the fence about wether or not you want to buy the device. Seagate is an awesome brand. In my opinion you can’t get a better quality product than this!,True,Beverly L Schueren

2.0 out of 5 stars,Unusably slow,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023","I bought this as a cheap way drive to install Linux onto.

Boot times are around 40-60 minutes and most applications time out or crash when trying to open them. I bought a similar Western Digital drive, and despite similar advertised data transfer speeds, it boots in less than 2 minutes and everything runs fine.I've repurposed this drive as media storage, but even for that it's painfully slow. Transferring 64GB of pictures from my camera takes about 9 hours with and average write speed of ~2MB/s.This hard drive might be ok as a backup if you keep your computer on all the time and speed isn't a concern.

The portable models I've had before (4TB) have been virtually silent, but this one is not. Immediately upon plugging it in for the first time, it starting making a fan-like whirring noise that has been constant. You'll notice it if you're in a very quiet location, but some moderate ambient noise in your environment would be enough to mask it. The noise is enough for me that it's not going to be acceptable leaving it connected constantly, but that's OK, I can demote it to an emergency backup drive.Noise aside, performance has been great so far. This is my fourth Seagate drive (previous ones have been the portable ones). My oldest one is about six years old. They've all held up well so far.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Seagate Expansion 16TB External Hard Drive HDD - USB 3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","This review is for the Seagate Expansion 16TB External Hard Drive HDD - USB 3.0There's nothing special about it.  It's just an external disk.  They will either fail in the beginning or last a long time.  I'm still burning it in and so far so good.I've been buying Seagate over the years because they included Paragon NTFS for Seagate, making it useful for Macs too.  I didn't actually pay attention if this one had it before I wiped it, since I already had Paragon on Mac.  I think you can get it from Seagate's web site if you hadn't installed it yet.  I usually just attach it to one system these days, usually Windows, and share it to the others.I just leave it as NTFS, since it's a much better file system and more useful, since it can hold Mac files, including old files with Resource Forks, without needing them to be zipped up.  The NTFS versions also cheaper than the Mac formatted versions.  If you really need it to be Mac, just reformat it on a Mac.  The only really bad Seagate disks, so far, were those old 1.5TB and 3TB batches.  But most of the other sizes have been reliable.  I just buy the cheapest one per TB at the time of purchase for my home backup.  My previous one was a Western Digital 12TB, and the one before that was a Seagate.  it's whatever was cheapest at the time.I generally buy single disks for backups, because they're much easier.  It's also much cheaper than RAID and less overall maintenance for my needs.  I usually buy a new single disk about once every 3 years +/- and start copying my previous disk contents to it and keep the old disks as backups.  That way I don't lose data if one disk fails.  Long ago, you needed to do that every 3-5 years before a disk actually fails.  These days, they're lasting longer than the typical 3-5 years because they go into sleep mode when not in use.  I've had older disks under 750GB fail on me, but other than a 1.5TB Seagate, I haven't had these disk fail in a long time.  My 2 TB Seagate is still running fine.  Of course, these are basically low use backup now.",True,Sunny Chen

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow, Reliable, & Shuckable.","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","I'm giving this 5 stars because it's a perfect back-up drive to support 3-2-1 backup strategy. Some general notes and considerations below:1. These are SMR drives, as are all 2.5"" hdd drives over 500gb. When these drives are new and empty, the write speeds are pretty comparable to other hard drives but as the fill up they do slow down a bit. If you are using these for backup and archival, you need reliable storage, not blazing fast speeds and these are great.2. These drives are Shuckable, meaning you can break open the case and take the hard drive out and use it in your own enclosure or laptop. This is important because if the drives USB connector wears out of breaks, you have options to recover your data and continue using the drive. Most Toshiba and Western Digital external hard drives have proprietary connections and can't be used in another enclosure, so if your USB port on those drives fails your entire drive is trash.3. High Capacity at low cost. You don't need the highest quality drive to protect your data, you need multiple decent quality drives so you can have multiple copies in case a drive fails on you. The price per TB of these drives is a great value.",True,Jim

I do use a 12cm USB fan in low speed mode to blow air across my external drives and that's made a huge difference in their reliability.  It doesn't really take much air flow to cool them.  I also use bitlocker-to-go to ensure that if a USB drive is stolen, it won't be useful to anyone.While I'd never use an external USB drive as primary storage (I have a neighbor who did so and lost precious photos), they work well for backup -- I personally use Macrium Reflect for that purpose.  And 16TB means I won't be worrying about running out of space.",True,ZimFromIrk

I have yet to (knock on wood) have one fail. I use them for storage of photos and videos and until I got an SSD drive, I'd edit off of these and they were fast enough to do that. But now I use them as back up after I have finished editing photos/videos on SSD.",True,JP Lawrence

For this not lasting for 5 years at least is horrible. I am going to have to crack the frame open and pull out the hardrive.

In the fine print it says, it is 'read only' for the MAC, you cannot put items onto this hard drive from a MAC.  They reference work arounds but even the descriptions are ridiculous.  Tech support never responded so I am just returning it before I waste more time and aggravation.  As frustrating as the product is, the misleading description is worse.",True,rob

The drive froze on me when I tried transferring files from my MacBook Pro.  Now I’m afraid I’ve lost several files, and I don’t know to fix that.  This is the first time in my 20 years of using Seagate products that something like this hs happened. So I wonder, now, if the company who sold this drive to me is going to contact me with some suggestions, or just ignore me.  I don’t want to send the drive back because it contains several gigs of data that is no longer on my laptop.  I just can’t access it.  I really need help, please!!",True,Mateo_MacGyver

1.0 out of 5 stars,Failed within hours of setting it up.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2023","I don't expect much from a hard drive, but I do expect to be able to transfer files to it and retrieve them reliably. Unfortunately, this failed both tests.I was copying barely 500GB of data to it, and less than half way through, the transfer speed dropped to 0B/S (!) and never recovered. I put my ear to the drive and it was making all sorts of horrible clicking and grinding noises you should never hear from a healthy drive. Out of curiosity I launched Crystal Disk Info, and while it still reported the drive as good, it was also reporting almost 10,000 combined read/write errors. It failed completely when I attempted to format it so I could return it to the store.Don't waste your time, money, or important files to this. It may be cheap for the capacity, but it's not worth it.I know Amazon likes to make things confusing and group reviews of different products together, so to clarify, this is a review for the Seagate One Touch Hub 4TB. I also didn't purchase this from Amazon, but from a certain popular office supply store.",True,titanicmaster
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have an iMac and it worked well,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2023","Decided to leave a review because of the fact that I have an iMac and it worked well. If you have an Apple device, just search for the other reviews on how to format it appropriately on Disk Utility (essentially erase and rename, then restart computer). I had no issues with it being recognized by the computer (also, plenty of reviews on how to solve this if it happens to you). The whole process from out of the box to functional was < 5 minutes and the majority was doing the restart. I guess that if this bothers you, this product isn't for you since it is not technically ready straight out of the box. On the other hand, it has great storage capability, performance is decent and it is quite affordable compared to similar options.",True,Rafael Garcia
